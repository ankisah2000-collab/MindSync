                "Modern life is noisy. We are constantly pinged, poked, and prompted by our devices, yet these very devices are often blind to our actual internal state. I noticed a recurring issue in my own life and those around me that is **Invisible Mental Fatigue**. We don't realize we're burnt out until we can't focus on a single sentence. We don't notice our social battery is dead until we're already snappy with friends and family. Current wellness apps are too intrusive and they ask \"How do you feel?\" ten times a day and require us to fill manual surveys. \n",
                "\n",
                "The problem is a lack of **Passive Resonance**. We need a system that feels what we feel without us having to explain it every five minutes.\n",

                "My goal with *MindSync* was to build a Digital Twin that mirrors our cognitive and emotional state. By looking at *how* we interact with our technology (our typing flux, our task hopping, our digital hygiene), we can map out our mental space. This isn't just about productivity, it's about preventatively managing stress and reclaiming our attention before it's completely fragmented.\n",

                "Given the high sensitivity of biometric and digital footprint data, I couldn't use a standard public dataset. Most mental health datasets are just surveys. So, I spent a lot of time designing a **High-Fidelity Synthetic Data Generator**. I wanted data that simulated real sensor streams like typing patterns, screen brightness toggles, and notification response lags.\n",
